To edit CSS, edit the "input.css" file in the "compile-css" directory and then run the Compile SASS/Less from the Dropdown with the Rocketship Icon Above.

Alternatively, for those at home, "npm install postcss" and all the plugins included in "compile-css/compile-css.js" and run "node compile-css/compile-css.js"
